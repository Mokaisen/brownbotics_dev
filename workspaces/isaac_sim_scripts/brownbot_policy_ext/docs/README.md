This package needs to be added to the extensions path by click settings in the extensions menu

After adding the folder isaac_sim_scripts in the extension folder, we need to search for brownbot and 
in the "Third Party" sections the extension will appear as: "BROWNBOT_POLICY_EXT". Once activated, the policy needs to be 
loaded by going to Window/Examples/Robotics Examples and in the window that appears we need to go to GENERAL and the 
brownbot policy should appear there.
